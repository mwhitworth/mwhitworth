### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, a developer based in Montreal, Canada. I've founded [PureType](https://puretype.ai/), which solves problems around professional developer onboarding and upskilling.

I work mainly in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), though I have professionally used C++, Perl, Python, R and Terraform in the past.

I maintain several open-source projects, including:
- [reverse_proxy_plug](https://github.com/tallarium/reverse_proxy_plug) - A reverse proxy plug for proxying a request to another URL
- [phoenix_better_table](https://github.com/mwhitworth/phoenix_better_table) - a basic HTML table as a Phoenix Live Component that supports filtering and sorting
- [relative_datetime](https://github.com/mwhitworth/relative_datetime) - a grammar and parser for specifying relative datetimes in Elixir
- [percy_client](https://github.com/mwhitworth/percy_client) - an Elixir client for the visual testing and regression service [Percy](https://percy.io/)
- [github_webhook](https://github.com/puretype/github_webhook) - a plug for Github webhook requests
