### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt, a developer from London.

I work mainly in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), though I have professionally used C++ and Perl in the past.

I maintain several open-source projects, including:
- [reverse_proxy_plug](https://github.com/tallarium/reverse_proxy_plug) - A reverse proxy plug for proxying a request to another URL
- [phoenix_better_table](https://github.com/mwhitworth/phoenix_better_table) - a basic HTML table as a Phoenix Live Component that supports filtering and sorting
